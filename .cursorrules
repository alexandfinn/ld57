- This project uses pnpm as its package manager.
- Use TypeScript exclusively for all code.
- Keep code modular:
   - Each component (Player, Monster, etc.) must manage its own state in its own file.
   - A separate global GameState (or interaction state) should handle events or interactions between components.
- All rendering must be done in the 3D scene via @react-three/fiber.
- Use drei whenever possible
- Code should be clear, maintainable, and scalable:
   - Prioritize clarity and separation of concerns.
   - Keep related logic (like a componentâ€™s state and its presentation) in the same file.
